# EDA_Case_Study_Banking
The notebook seems to be focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a credit-related dataset. Here's a breakdown of the contents, which will help you create a README file:

### Title
**Credit EDA Assignment**

### Description
This notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit-related dataset. The primary objective is to understand the data, clean it, and derive insights that could potentially help in credit risk assessment or other financial analyses.

### Dataset
- The dataset contains 307,511 rows and 73 columns.
- Columns represent various features related to credit applications, such as `FLAG_DOCUMENT_*`, `EXT_SOURCE_*`, and other customer attributes.
- Certain columns are removed based on their irrelevance or high missing value ratio.

### Key Steps and Analysis
1. **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: 
   - The dataset is loaded, and the initial few rows and columns are inspected.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values: Columns with more than 40% missing values are removed to ensure data quality.
   - Irrelevant columns (such as `NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE`, `WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START`, and flags like `FLAG_MOBIL`, `FLAG_EMP_PHONE`) are dropped to focus on relevant features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - The notebook focuses on selecting meaningful features (`EXT_SOURCE_*`) and removing others that might not contribute significantly to the analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Further analysis would typically involve visualizations, correlation analysis, and feature distributions to identify patterns or anomalies within the data. (Ensure to add more details if present in the later cells).

### Dependencies
- The notebook likely uses libraries such as:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.

### Instructions for Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

### Results and Insights
- The README should also summarize any key insights or conclusions derived from the analysis, such as important predictors for credit risk, notable correlations, or interesting patterns observed in the data.

### Future Work
- Potential directions for future analysis, such as building predictive models, conducting more in-depth feature engineering, or integrating external datasets for enhanced analysis.
